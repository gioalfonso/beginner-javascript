every elements has an event when it is being interacted.
we use event listener to listen for the events.

el.addEventListener('click', callback func here)
                   event    callback function usually anonymous
 - will take to arguments usually, sometimes 3
 - you can also use a named function outside and pass it in as reference
        
        function handleClick() {

        }
    **naming function handle you can do to 
    remind you its a callback or specific function
    that gets passed in to event handler.

- using outside function makes it reusable to different event listener

===REMOVE EVENT LISTENER========================

el.removeEventListener('click', handleClick);
                  what event to stop,   function you wish to stop

** If you need to remove an event listener
   - you must use a named function
   - or you can use arrow function stored in variable
   - Anonymous function cannot be removed.
