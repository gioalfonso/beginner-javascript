canvas -
    - the way that this works is that you go ahead and grab
      on to the CANVAS then you grab on to this thing 
      called CONTEXT (either 2d or 3d).
    - then you've got a set of APIs, set of methods that are used
      for drawing to the canvas (thing about like MS Paint)

* The canvas is the element and the place where we do our drawing
  is called the context.

* ctx - common naming convention for the context

ex.
const canvas = document.querySelector('#etch-a-sketch');
const ctx = document.getContext('2d');

Tips:
  If you are simply taking variable from a property on an object
  You can short form (short cut) this.
  This is called DE STRUCTURING

const width = canvas.width;
const height = canvas.height;  // the ojbect here is canvas

const { width, height } = canvas;

Math.random() - give random number less the 1 (0-.99999)
Math.floor() - rounds it to 0-.99999
Math.ceil() - round it
